# Arbitrary Contract Calls Cross Chain Protocol
Arbitrary Contract Calls Specification Document to document the requirements for a protocol optimized for arbitraty contract calls across chain.

## Problem
1. Executing arbitrary contracts on Ethereum from another chain is hard
2. There exists no protocol optimized to do fast 

## Protocol Requirements:
1. Consensus 
2. Mempool 
3. Chain Database
4. EVM ABCI Code Manager
5. Module Manager
6. IBC Functionality
7. Web Assembly Module
